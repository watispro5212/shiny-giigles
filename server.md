## 📜 SERVER RULES DIRECTIVE (Quick Reference)

These are the core directives to be pasted into the `#📜-rules` channel:

1. **Maintain Professionalism (No Toxicity)**: Respect all operatives. Harassment, slurs, discrimination, and excessive toxicity will result in immediate sanction.
2. **No Unsolicited Advertising**: Do not post invite links, self-promote outside of `#showcase`, or DM advertise to members.
3. **Follow the Framework (Keep it on-topic)**: Ensure your discourse matches the channel topic. Bots belong in `#bot-commands`. Support goes in `#open-ticket`.
4. **No NSFW or Illegal Content**: Immediate permanent ban for any NSFW media, gore, or discussion of illegal activities.
5. **Respect Staff Directives**: If a Moderator instructs you to drop a topic or move channels, comply immediately. Disputes should be handled in private tickets, not public channels.
6. **No Spam or Malicious Links**: Spamming text, emojis, or malicious/phishing links will trigger an auto-ban via the Wick/Beemo Sentinel layer.

## 🔗 WEBHOOK ARCHITECTURE & AUTOMATIONS

> [!NOTE]
> Webhooks decouple bot dependencies and allow external services to post directly to Discord. Configure these in **Channel Settings > Integrations > Webhooks**.

### 1. GitHub Actions (Releases & Commits)
- **Target Channels**: `🆙-changelog` and `🐙-github-feed`
- **Use Case**: Automatically push new repository commits, pull requests, and version releases.
- **Service**: Native GitHub Webhooks + Zapier formatting.
- **Setup**: Create a webhook in the target channel, paste the URL into GitHub Repo Settings -> Webhooks. Set Content-Type to `application/json`.

### 2. Uptime Monitoring (BetterUptime)
- **Target Channel**: `🟢-status`
- **Use Case**: Post live alerts when the bot, website, or API shards go down.
- **Setup**: Link UptimeRobot or BetterUptime to a channel Webhook URL. It will automatically post offline/online state changes.

### 3. Zapier Social Feed
- **Target Channel**: `📢-announcements`
- **Use Case**: Automatically syndicate posts from Twitter/X or YouTube to Discord.
- **Setup**: Create a webhook named `Nexus Socials`, link the URL to Zapier. Format the message to include the video/tweet link.

### 4. Direct Support Feed
- **Target Channel**: `🎯-support-ops`
- **Use Case**: If using an external CRM or form (Tally/Typeform), route new high-priority tickets directly to staff via webhook.

## ⚔️ VERIFICATION PROTOCOL — Dual-Layer Sentinel

### Layer 1 — Wick Bot (CAPTCHA Gate)

1. Create a `#🔐-verification` channel visible **only to `🌑 New Entity`**. All other roles have it hidden.
2. Enable Wick CAPTCHA Mode — force CAPTCHA completion in `#🔐-verification`.
3. On success: Wick removes `🌑 New Entity` and assigns `🧬 Operative` role automatically.
4. Account age minimum: **7 days**. Accounts under threshold receive an auto-kick with DM explanation.
5. Mass-join raid threshold: **20+ joins in 60 seconds** → auto-lockdown. Manual clear by Moderator+.

### Layer 2 — Beemo (Behavioural Anti-Bot)

1. Deploy Beemo in **Monitor Mode** for 7 days. Review flagged accounts daily.
2. After calibration, switch to **Auto-Ban Mode** for confirmed bot fingerprints.
3. All auto-bans are logged to `🚨-security-feed` with full metadata.
