# 🌐 NexusBot — Complete Discord Server Blueprint

Welcome to the **NexusBot Support Server Blueprint**. Use this comprehensive guide as a checklist to build and structure your Discord server perfectly from scratch. Avoid skipping steps—**especially role hierarchy positioning**—to ensure that tickets, verification, and moderation systems function correctly.

## 📖 How to read this guide

| Syntax          | Meaning                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Take Action** | Concrete action to perform in your server settings.                      |
| **Pick one**    | Choose option A _or_ B — don’t mix unless you have a specific use case.  |
| `@everyone`     | The default Discord base role — not a custom role.                       |
| `⚙️`            | Settings navigation, e.g. `Server name (top left) → Server Settings → …` |

---

## 🏗️ TL;DR — Quick Build Order

1. **Initialize Server:** Create the server and set `Server Settings → Community` (optional) / verification level.
2. **Setup Roles:** Create roles in `Server Settings → Roles`. **Exact order is critical** (see Section 2). Drag powerful roles like **Architect** to the top.
3. **Draft Categories:** Create empty categories first, then populate them with channels (see Section 3).
4. **Configure Category Permissions:** Set **permissions directly on the categories** (see Section 4). Then click "Sync Permissions" on channels inside them.
5. **Invite Bots:** Invite **Nexus bot** and any other utility bots. Ensure their roles are dragged above the users they interact with.
6. **Screening & Welcome:** Configure **Welcome** / **Membership Screening** features (see Section 5).
7. **Populate Content:** Paste the **start-here** and **rules** text (see Sections 6 & 7). Run setup commands like `/ticket-setup` and `/verify-setup` (see Section 8).

## 1. ⚙️ Server Basics — First 10 Minutes

Navigate to **Server Settings** (click the gear icon or server name drop-down).

| Step | Navigation      | Action Requirements                                                                   |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `Overview`      | **Server name:** Choose a clean name, e.g., `Nexus Protocol` or `NexusBot · Support`. |
| 2    | `Overview`      | **Icon:** Upload a high-quality icon matching your branding.                          |
| 3    | `Overview`      | **Description:** Summarize your server.                                               |
| 4    | `Safety Setup`  | **Verification level:** Set to **Medium** or **High** to stop spammers.               |
| 5    | `Notifications` | **Default Setting:** Set to **Only @mentions** so new members aren't spammed.         |
| 6    | `Privacy`       | **Moderation:** Enforce **2FA** on moderation actions for extra security.             |

---

## 2. 🎭 Role Hierarchy & Global Permissions

### ⚠️ Why order is crucial

- Users **only receive permissions** depending on their position in the role hierarchy. A role cannot moderate or assign a role higher than its own.
- **Bots** can only interact with or assign roles **below their own highest role**. Put **Bots above** levels, verified flags, and regular members.

### 🗂️ Create Roles (Top to Bottom)

**Path:** `Server Settings → Roles → Create Role`

Create **one by one** and drag to match this exact order (Row 1 is highest priority). This includes staff ranks, integrations, fun roles, and leveling roles:

| #   | Role Name              | Hex Color      | Who gets it                                    |
| --- | ---------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `👑 Nexus Architect`   | `#FF4444`      | Server Owner & Founders                        |
| 2   | `📈 Administrator`     | `#FF0055`      | Senior Staff / Co-Owners                       |

| 13  | `👑 Level 50 · Legend` | `#E6E6FA`      | Max active chatter rank                        |
| 14  | `🏆 Level 30 · Master` | `#DDA0DD`      | High active chatter rank                       |
| 15  | `🌟 Level 10 · Adept`  | `#BA55D3`      | Mid active chatter rank                        |
| 16  | `✨ Level 5 · Novice`  | `#8A2BE2`      | Base active chatter rank                       |

| 20  | `🔊 Muted`             | `#111111`      | For custom manual muting (Deny Send Msgs)      |

### 🔐 Global Permissions per Role

_(Configure these toggles via `Server Settings → Roles`. For global roles, if a permission is not listed below, leave its toggle **OFF**. Also ensure `Send Messages` and `View Channels` are ON for everyone except the Muted role!)_

#### 👑 Owners & Senior Staff

- **`👑 Nexus Architect` & `📈 Administrator`**
  - **ON**: `Administrator` (This automatically grants all other permissions).
- **`⚙️ Core Team`**
  - **ON**: `Manage Server`, `Manage Roles`, `Manage Channels`, `Kick Members`, `Ban Members`, `Moderate Members` (Timeout), `Manage Messages`, `Manage Webhooks`.

#### 🛡️ Moderation Team

  - **ON**: `Kick Members`, `Ban Members`, `Moderate Members` (Timeout), `Manage Messages`.
- **`🔨 Trial Mod`**
  - **ON**: `Moderate Members` (Timeout), `Manage Messages`.
- **`💠 Support Staff`**
  - All moderation/admin toggles stay **OFF**. (They will get special access specifically in the Tickets category).

#### 🤖 Bots

- **`🤖 Nexus Bot`**
  - **ON**: `Administrator` (Strongly recommended so it can freely create/manage private ticket channels and moderate users).
- **`🛠️ Utility Bots`**

## 5. 👋 Welcome & Member Screening

1. **System Welcome:** Go to `Server Settings → System Messages Channel`. Set it to `🚀┃start-here` or a dedicated `👋┃welcome`.
2. **Screening:** Enable standard built-in rules screening via the **Community Settings** tab to force users to click "I Agree" before interacting.
3. **Optional Log:** Send automated welcome logs into your `⚠️┃mod-log` channel to easily catch suspicious account creation dates.

---

## 6. 📝 Onboarding Message Template (Paste in `🚀┃start-here`)

```markdown
# Welcome to the Nexus Protocol Server! 🚀

Thanks for stopping by! Please take a quick moment to orient yourself:

**1.** 📜 Read our rules in <#CHANNEL_ID_HERE>. We strongly prohibit toxicity and sharing sensitive/secret tokens here.
**2.** ✅ Verify your account by hitting the button below or interacting with the screening popup to gain full server access.
**3.** 🤖 Looking to add NexusBot? Head straight over to <#CHANNEL_ID_HERE> to find the official invite link.
**4.** 🆘 Need assistance? Use the community <#CHANNEL_ID_HERE> or open a private ticket over at <#CHANNEL_ID_HERE>.
**5.** 🐛 Found a bug or glitch? Make a post in <#CHANNEL_ID_HERE> outlining exactly what happened.

Have an amazing time here!
— The Nexus Team
```

---

## 7. ⚖️ Basic Server Rules Template (Paste in `📜┃rules`)

```markdown
1. **Be Respectful:** No hate speech, organized harassment, or NSFW content. Keep things PG-13.
2. **Protect Your Data (No Secrets in Public):** Never post Bot Tokens, MongoDB URLs, Passwords, or exact `.env` files in public. Staff will never DM you for a password.
3. **High-Quality Support Format:** When asking for help, explain what you did, what you expected, the exact error provided, and your Nexus version. Include screenshots if possible.
4. **Use Appropriate Channels:** Keep spam command execution in the `🤖┃bot-commands` channel.
5. **Follow Discord Guidelines:** See the official [Discord Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
6. **Enforcement:** Moderators have the final say and may timeout, kick, or ban users who intentionally disrupt the server.
```

## 8. 🛠️ Final Setup: Bot Commands

Execute these slash commands when the server layout is fully polished:

| Step | Command / Action                      | Result                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Invite Bot & ensure highest placement | Resolves hierarchy-related permission errors.    |
| 2    | `/ticket-setup` in `📩┃open-a-ticket` | Creates the core interactive ticket UI.          |
| 3    | `/verify-setup` in `🚀┃start-here`    | Maps your customized `✅ Verified` role.         |
| 4    | `/log-setup` pointing to `⚠️┃mod-log` | Routes automated moderation logging.             |
| 5    | `/automod-setup`                      | Configures automated anti-spam and word filters. |
| 6    | `/starboard-setup`                    | Engages the fun starboard module!                |

---

## 9. 🧽 Regular Maintenance (Monthly)

- [ ] Clear out or archive ancient, dead support tickets.
- [ ] Evaluate and update channel slowmode timings.
- [ ] Ensure **`📊┃status`** reflects the latest version numbers.
- [ ] Cull unused or empty permission roles.
- [ ] Re-test your **bot invite link** to make sure OAuth permissions are still optimal.
